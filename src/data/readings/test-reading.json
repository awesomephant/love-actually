  "body": "(by uncle jamie)\n\n‘Tis Better To Have Loved And Lost Than To Have Never Loved At All, Actually\n\nOn music and silence in *love actually*, with particular reference to the Sugababes’ *Too Lost In You*\n\n\n\nAlan Sugar. Babe the pig: two British icons. Put them together and what have you got? Three, perhaps even four more: the Sugababes. And as such, they offer us something uniquely British to the uniquely British release of the uniquely British *love actually*, in the form of their song, *Too Lost In You*.\n\nThe spelling of the song’s title is disputed. Apple Music, Spotify and the YouTube channel, (or the Tube lost in You channel), of Elektra Chiang all use the conventional T.O.O. and Y.O.U. The YouTube channel of MACosmin, on the other hand, uses the single letter U and the numerical figure 2. This adds colour to the scene in which the song is used, where we are confronted with not one, but two enormous raspberry-covered nipples.\n\nThe wording of the title is interesting either way. To be **too** lost in something implies that one can also be not lost enough, or lost to just the right degree. To explore this idea further, one might ask what we most commonly get lost in. A maze. A maze is possibly the best instance in which one might get just the right amount of lost: not too lost to become truly scared, nor too geographically present to the point of boredom. Is it any wonder, then, that Richard Curtis chose Sugababes' *Too Lost In You* over *Maybe I’m A Maze* by Paul McCartney & Wings?\n\nNo, instead, the characters here are presented as being too lost in each other, to such an extent that, as the lyrics not only of Sugababes but also Dido’s *Here With Me* stipulate, (for both songs are used in the film), they can’t sleep or think. Sugababes go further by saying even their mouths can’t speak. Andrew Lincoln’s character Mark, played by Andrew Lincoln, (see *love actually*), displays this beautifully in the scene where he uses cardboard signs instead of speech to communicate his true feelings, while *Silent Night* is aptly being played in the background.\n\nAfter this scene, we see his mouth regain its ability to speak as he says, \"Enough. Enough Now.\" And so he is no longer **too** lost, but just lost enough. What we learn from this is that when we get **too**lost in someone or something, we ought to fight our way out into clarity by communicating our feelings, for at Christmas, Mark's sign tells us, you tell the truth. \n\nAnd so may I invite you to lose yourself to some degree in this Christmas film, *love actually(*?)"
