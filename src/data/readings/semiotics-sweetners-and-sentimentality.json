  "body": "or, a \\[DVD] case for Love Actually.\n\n(by eilis xoxoxoxox)\n\nThe thing looks cheap, something about bright red on a white backdrop, something about the ultra-bold typography used exclusively on the word ‘love’, something about Martine McCutcheon’s face. This ‘semiological schema’ (*Barthes*). And this happens inside the case, as we watch the film, too. The thing itself cost me £3.99. I adore the thing. (And in a piece of writing about sentimentality, I’m allowed to tell you that.)\n\n“A sentimentalist is simply one who desires to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it.” – *Oscar Wilde*.\n\nWhen we consider the here-poignant verb choice of ‘paying’, one problem with sentimentality is that it offers a shortcut to certain emotions without the price of their real-life experience. I’m talking about **love**. (Note bold.) Love Actually, the film, is like artificial sweeteners. All of the sugary emotions, none of the calories or weight of reality.\n\nArtificial sweeteners, the thing – based on ‘Sweet-n-Low’ – the packet is made of paper. Red text (again), pink paper. As you rip through to open it, the powder is so light, some spills out onto the kitchen counter. The thing itself can be described as ‘saccharine’. It makes us think of cancer, multiplication, it means ‘too much’. (*Leslie Jamieson*)\n\nWhy does Love Actually feel so good? Because it is metaphorically ‘dipped in yoghurt and covered in chocolate buttons’ (*Love Actually*). But is our problem with it, as artists, an attack on sentimentality as a cheap, manipulative artistic expression, or simply an attack on unsophisticated taste itself? Is it okay that I **love** it?"
