  "body": "or, a \\[DVD] case for Love Actually.\n\nThe thing looks cheap, something about bright red on a white backdrop, something about the ultra-bold typography used exclusively on the word ‘love’, something about Martine McCutcheon’s face. This ‘semiological schema’ (Barthes). And this happens inside the case, as we watch the film, too. The thing itself cost me £3.99. I adore the thing. (And in a piece of writing about sentimentality, I’m allowed to tell you that.)\n\n> A sentimentalist is simply one who desires to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it. *(Oscar Wilde)*"
